<p>I'm Gloria, and I previously worked as a personal assistant/secretary at a company before leaving that position. Initially, I was planning to further my studies next year. However, I recently discovered an opportunity in the field of data science. After discussing it with my brother, who already works as a data scientist, we decided that I should pursue this path. I'm going to start by gaining some foundational knowledge and skills in data science, and then reassess my educational plans to align with this new career direction.
