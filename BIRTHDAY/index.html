    <h1>Thank You, FRED!</h1>
    <p>Dear FREDERICK,</p>
    <p>
        On this special day, my birthday, I want to take a moment to express my deepest gratitude to you. 
        Thank you for always being there for me, and supporting me through and through
        Your guidance and encouragement have been very helpful.
    </p>
    <p>
        I especially want to thank you for helping me register for the DevOps Engineer program. 
        That opportunity has truly transformed my life and enabled me to create projects like this one. 
        You believed in me and for that, I am forever grateful.
    </p>
